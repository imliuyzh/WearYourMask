# [WearYourMask!](https://imliuyzh.github.io/WearYourMask/)
A web application that checks the person on the selected image if he/she wear his/her mask. In the end, a notification will show up telling the users about the result. Note that the result may not be 100% accurate.

### Note
Due to the TensorFlow.js dependency, WearYourMask! **REQUIRES** WebGL supports (https://appuals.com/fix-webgl-is-not-supported/). If the application still does not work even after following the article, then you may want to consider to get a new graphic card or simply upgrade your device.
